# run-buddy
11/16 9:46pm - encountered error when trying to push .gitignore and index.html from local machine to github:
error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:bctan87/run-buddy.git'
The error prevented me from pushing
Used "git push -f origin master" to go around the error
Push was a success, 2 files were pushed to github
